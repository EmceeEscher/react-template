# react-template
Basic template for React projects

Things you need to do to use this:

1. Download yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/). I had to follow instructions here to get Windows to recognize `yarn` command: (https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2504)
2. Run `yarn` in console to download necessary packages.
3. Run `yarn start` to run example app, then go to `localhost:3000` to see web app.
